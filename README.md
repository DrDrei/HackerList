# Abstract 2017

In todays day and age, technology is advancing to new heights thus we must strive to achieve greatest capacity of productivity.  

# Introduction
This is an android application that focuses on optimizing your efficiency in the real world. It bridges the gap between the complex technologies and the infinite mind of the user. It allows the user to capture and convince themselves that they are actually being more productive than they are. Mayhaps without the use of this app, the user might be more productive than without.

# On a more srs note
We tried to combine and Todolist and a countdown timer to allow the user to track time more efficiently. Attempted to use and explore the Model View Presenter pattern.
